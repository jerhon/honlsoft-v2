description: "A few of my favorite software development books from the past few years.."
---

Every year I try to pick up a few engineering books and read them.
I decided to look through my bookshelf and compile a list of some of my favorites I've gone through in the past few years and record them in a blog post.
Hopefully in a few more years, I will do this again.

# The Pragmatic Programmer

This book offers a wealth of advice to software developers in small topics.
This is a great book I wish I would have picked up when I was a younger developer.
I go back to it from time to time and just read random topics and find new things to think about often.

# Clean Architecture

Building software is messy.
Clean architecture focuses on building software from the Domain model out in focused layers that divides domain logic from external dependencies.

It starts with the basics of software architecture and builds a foundation which eventually leads to an architecture inverts those external dependencies to be at the outer layer of the application.
This is drastically different from many architectures of yesterday where the database is the center of the architecture.

Even if the architecture pattern doesn't fit for a particular project, the concepts this books go over make it a very worthwhile read.


# Software Architecture: The Hard Parts

This book focuses on several challenges with software architecture and various methods to break down and decouple software.
In the face of an insurmountable monolith, this is a great book to read through.


# DevOps Handbook

This is a book with a wealth of ideas on implementing DevOps.
From getting started with DevOps, creating transformation teams, building Deployment pipelines, getting actionable feedback in deployments, to implementing innovation through continual learning this book is a great resource.

One reason I really like this book is that it uses a lot of case studies and research to back up its positions.
Given the authors and their contributions to the DevOps community, it's hard to find a better set of practices outlined well.

# Wrapping Up

Reading software engineering books is a great window into how other people approach software engineering.
I hope you'll find a book on this list that piques your interest.

If you do or have a suggested book, please share or like this post website on LinkedIn.
I would love to hear what you're reading.
