About a year ago, I wrote an application that displayed COVID-19 Statitics in a web application.
It was a fun little practical Angular project to write.

Last week, [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) stopped collecting and reporting new data.
This is the primary data source for my application's numbers.
While it is possible to get data directly from the CDC now, the information isn't as easily available to access as the APIs for the COVID Tracking Project.
So, I will be taking the application offline over the weekend.
With COVID-19 numbers trending downward signficantly, I don't plan on updating the application to obtain data from a new source.

Thanks to everyone who gave me feedback on the application!
