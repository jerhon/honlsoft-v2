I will be starting a series named Javascript tips.  This is a set of tips aimed at developers of things I've learned over the past few years as I've been working in the industry.  This will be a variety of things from overlooked language features, to tooling that should be considered on javascript projects. 

Some of these may seem fairly straight forward, but believe me, I have seen major multi-year, multi-million dollar web development projects that fail to use even the most basic tools practices for modern Javascript out there today.

I hope you find this useful.
