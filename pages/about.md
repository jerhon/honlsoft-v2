This website is my personal musings in software development. All opinions are my own.

# About Me
As an accomplished software developer, I possess over 14 years of extensive experience in the field of professional software development, augmented by 20 years of programming experience. My passion lies in creating software and tackling the complex technical challenges that arise during its development. In particular, I take pleasure in leading teams towards successful software implementations and delivering projects to completion.

Presently, I hold the position of Senior Application Developer and specialize in full-stack web development. Over the years, I have been involved in a diverse range of projects that encompassed integrations, web development, and light mobile development. I have leveraged a variety of technology stacks such as .NET Core, .NET Framework, Java, Spring Framework, AngularJS / Angular, Apache Cordova, C/C++, and numerous others.

## My Software Journey
My journey in software development began in middle school when I learned BASIC and started exploring the intricacies of cryptography. My father helped me write my first program, and I fondly remember poring over the code in an attempt to comprehend its meaning. This early exposure sparked my passion for coding, and I quickly progressed to Visual Basic, QBasic, and eventually C++ / C. One of my favorite projects during high school involved writing a boot loader, which I proudly showcased to my peers.

After graduating high school, I enrolled in college for computer science, where I honed my skills in various programming languages, including Java, and secured my first professional programming gig as an intern with IBM.

Over the years, I have worked for several companies in Fargo, including a Smart Metering company where I spent around a decade building backend software and creating libraries to interface with specific protocols to the devices. I also had the opportunity to lead a small team in React development. At an industrial supply distribution company, I wrote various software to support business operations, including building internal integrations and leading a team to create a web application that streamlined workflow processes. Additionally, I spent several years in the crop insurance industry, where I performed conversions on legacy applications to the newer technology stacks such as React and .NET Core.

Programming has been a lifelong passion for me, and I have been fortunate enough to transform that passion into a rewarding career.
