This website is my personal musings in software development. Typically articles and opinions written here are from projects I've been working on at work or home for fun.

# About Me

I'm a software developer with over 14 years of professional software development experience and 20 years of programming experience. I enjoy building software, and the technical challenges that rise from building it. Particularly, I enjoy bringing projects to completion and leading teams to successful software implementations.

I'm currently Senior Application Developer primarily focused on web development.

I have been involved in development for a wide range of projects ranging from integrations, web development, and light mobile development. This has been in a variety of different technology stacks such as .NET Core, .NET Framework, Java, Spring Framework, AngularJS / Angular, Apache Cordova, C/C++, and others.

## How I Started

I started writing software in middle school and started out learning BASIC. My first experience coding was from a book on cryptography for kids on "making your own secret codes". There was a BASIC program in the back of the book, and I asked my dad to write it for me. I remember reading through the code trying to understand what it meant.

After that first program, I began my journey in coding. I started learning Visual Basic, and QBasic. Eventually, I moved on to C++ / C. Perhaps my favorite accomplishment in high school was writing a boot loader, and putting it on a floppy disk. It was fun programming various hardware, bringing it in to school and showing it off to other students.

After high school, I went to college for computer science. Most of the coursework was in Java, but I worked in various other languages as well. I was able to do an internship with IBM for approximately a year and a half while I was going to school, which was my first time programming professionally.

Programming and building software was something I really enjoyed growing up, and now that I am older have turned that passion into a career.
